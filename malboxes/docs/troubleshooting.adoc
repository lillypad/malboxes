== WinRM issues

Verify

* In the VM via VNC/RDP: is the WinRM service is running? did the
  configuration happened?

    winrm get winrm/config

* Host: VirtualBox NAT rule is in place and proper port is exposed to packer

    VBoxManage list vms
    VBoxManage showvminfo packer-virtualbox-iso-XXXXXXXXXX | grep "NIC.*Rule"

* VM: Windows firewall rule for 5985 is in place (via GUI)
* VM: Verified the NIC's network realm (public, work, private) and verified if firewall rule is according
* Host: Telnet connects to host mapped port (shown in output)
* VM: Sniffing with wireshark on port 5985 (should see SYN then SYN/ACKs)

Also you can try this WinRM script (you need to install pywinrm module):

[source,python]
----
import winrm

s = winrm.Session('localhost:3935', auth=('malboxes', 'malboxes'))
r = s.run_cmd('powershell', ['winrm', 'get', 'winrm/config/winrs'])

print(r.status_code)
print(r.std_out)
print(r.std_err)
----
