= ESXi / vSphere Setup

== Firewall rules required

From your machine (where malboxes is installed) to the ESXi server

* SSH (22)
* VNC (packer will try allocating 5900 upwards until it finds a working port)

From your machine to the running guest for provisioning

* WinRM (5985)

== VNC Access

Opening the ESX firewall is necessary. On version 6.5 this works:

    esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r gdbserver

Otherwise look at implementing the advice in here: https://gist.github.com/jasonberanek/4670943

== Troubleshooting

=== No IP Address on guest

You need a DHCP server on the same network segment. ESXi doesn't seem to
provide his own. You can create a simple DHCP server on an Ubuntu server with
isc-dhcp-server.

=== Misc.

Something packer said I needed to do:

    esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
